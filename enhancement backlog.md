# A Backlog of Enhancement Ideas for the plugin

* Integration with the VASTFMT plugin
* Display track names from internet streams if available
* Move "Main Show Playlist" config option into its own config setting section
* RDS Output of playing info (using RDS plugin?)
* Option to mix mp3 audio playlist tracks to stop any quiet spots at end of tracks transisitioning to next track - perhaps with beat matching?
* Add a music Icon into the FPP header when background music plugin is active - need to add new hooks in core fpp for fully functionality
* make volume slider wider again
* add link to https://www.internet-radio.com/stations/christmas/ for streaming url's
* work out how to handle immediate start of fpp sequence with media whilst background music playing
* make css not inline - need change to core fpp to allow exposing css/js.images folders to apache
*
