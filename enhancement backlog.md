# A Backlog of Enhancement Ideas for the plugin

* Integration with the VASTFMT plugin
* RDS Output of playing info (using RDS plugin?)
* Add a music Icon into the FPP header when background music plugin is active - need to add new hooks in core fpp for fully functionality
* make volume slider wider again
* add link to https://www.internet-radio.com/stations/christmas/ for streaming url's
* work out how to handle immediate start of fpp sequence with media whilst background music playing
* make css not inline - need change to core fpp to allow exposing css/js.images folders to apache
* need to figure out volume control for K16 type capes with PCM on pcm5102
*
