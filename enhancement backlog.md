# A Backlog of Enhancement Ideas for the plugin

* Integration with the VASTFMT plugin
* Display track names from internet streams if available
* Make sure API docs cover url streaming
* Move "Main Show Playlist" config option into its own config setting section
* Create auto generated PSA from text input - probably using Piper
* RDS Output of playing info (using RDS plugin?)
* Option to mix mp3 audio playlist tracks to stop any quiet spots at end of tracks transisitioning to next track - perhaps with beat matching?
* Add a music Icon into the FPP header when background music plugin is active
* make volume slider wider again
* add link to https://www.internet-radio.com/stations/christmas/ for streaming url's
* make speaker icons decrease and increase volume slider value
* work out how to handle immediate start of fpp sequence with media whilst background music playing
