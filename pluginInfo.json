	"description": "Enhances Falcon Player by adding independent background music playback during pre-show sequences with seamless transitions to your main synchronized show. Works alongside FPP's scheduler to play audio-only playlists or internet streams while your pre-show sequence runs, then provides smooth fade-out transitions with brightness control when starting your main show. Features include configurable fade times, blackout periods, automatic volume management, playlist shuffling, optional crossfading between tracks to eliminate silence, Text-to-Speech announcements with Piper TTS, up to 20 configurable PSA buttons for quick announcements, and optional post-show return to pre-show state. Perfect for creating professional atmospheres during crowd-gathering periods before your synchronized light show begins. Requires the fpp-brightness plugin for smooth brightness transitions with MultiSync support across all controllers.",
