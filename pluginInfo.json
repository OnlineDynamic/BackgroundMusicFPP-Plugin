	"description": "Enhances Falcon Player by adding independent background music playback during pre-show sequences with seamless transitions to your main synchronized show. Works alongside FPP's scheduler to play audio-only playlists while your pre-show sequence runs, then provides smooth fade-out transitions with brightness control when starting your main show. Features include configurable fade times, blackout periods, automatic volume management, playlist shuffling, and optional post-show return to pre-show state. Perfect for creating professional atmospheres during crowd-gathering periods before your synchronized light show begins. NOTE: Requires the fpp-brightness plugin for smooth brightness transitions with MultiSync support.",
